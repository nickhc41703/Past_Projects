The regional analysis was the final group project that I had for my data mining class. We were given a region including four states (kansas, missouri, oklahoma, and arkansas) and make a new traffic law based off of the
data that was given to us. we used the tools that our professor gave us throughout the semester to use on the select data. My group discovered that the main crashes that happened were from rear ending and going into 
a ditch off the side of the road. We also saw that the leading weather conditions that were reported were rain and snow. This lead us to assume that the driver was going fast through bad weather conditions and either 
rear end the person in front, or drive off of the road into a ditch. After making that assumption, we came up with the law that drivers can drive at most 20 mph during harsh weather conditions, specifically rain and 
snow.
